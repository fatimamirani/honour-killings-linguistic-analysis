# Honour Killings Linguistic Analysis

This project conducts a feminist linguistic and textual analysis of 50 English-language news reports on honour killings in Pakistan, published between 2016 and 2025. It combines tools from computational linguistics (spaCy, AntConc, pandas, matplotlib) with feminist theory and discourse analysis.

## 🔍 Objective
To explore how media headlines and content linguistically frame honour killings, especially through passive constructions, agency erasure, and ideological language.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (spaCy, pandas, matplotlib)
- AntConc (for concordance and cluster analysis)
- Microsoft Excel (manual annotation)
